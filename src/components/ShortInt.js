        It is too hard to say at this point. Hedge funds are changing their
        positions more frequently now that the price of GME has lowered. It is
        possible that they are still heavily in this short ball game, but we
        won't know accurate information until it is disclosed on 2/9. Will
        likely hold off on updating the short position until more concrete
        numbers come out.
